# Sail – Serverless RAG Stack

Sail is a fullstack Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) project for students to get answers only based on the uploaded material. It combines AWS serverless primitives (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Secrets Manager, Lambda Layers) with a lightweight Next.js frontend. Users create chat sessions, upload plain text documents, trigger ingestion to build a FAISS index, and query the index with OpenAI models.
